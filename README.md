## IfInjector

Decided to learn C# to gain an understanding of the language features available there (vs. Java). Experimented with frameworks for developing cross platform mobile applications using C#. I found options for "mobile capable" dependency injection frameworks lacking and decided to write my own. I also used this as an opportunity to learn the LINQ framework which provides a means to compile expressions into byte-code (on non-mobile platforms).

The project originally started as a fork of the FInjector framework, but was eventually rewritten for performance. For a brief few days the framework was near the top of some of the C# dependency injection framework benchmarks - you can find some references to it on the internet archive:
